# double-theremin
2X THE THEREMIN

This project is a fun Web Audio API app that is intended to simulate two theremin instruments. One changes pitch based on the Y position of the user's mouse, and one does so based on the X position (when pressed down).

Planned improvements include:

- better theremin graphics!
- some visual representation of the pitch (not sure how it will be represented yet)
- possible drone pitches by holding keyboard buttons

This was a very simple project, but I had blast making it and even more fun playing with it! Hope you enjoy!
